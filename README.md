# Dijkstra Visualization NetworkX
 Using Python's NetworkX library in order to randomly generate a graph. The graph contains nodes and edges, we then can compute the quickest possible route to traverse nodes by using dijkstra's algorithm.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- matplotlib 3.7
- networkx 3.1

### Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/groenern/Dijkstra-NetworkX-Implementation.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Usage
To run the path finding algorithm, execute `python main.py` in the project root directory. The project will first generate a randomly generated graph (nodes and edges), and display it to the screen. The user then has the choice to select two nodes. The program will find the fastest path between nodes, output it to the console, and draw the path in green.
